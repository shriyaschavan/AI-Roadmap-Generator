I want you to enhance the Timeline Visualization section in results.html to make it more polished, consulting-grade, and information-rich. Keep all existing functionality fully intact. Apply these upgrades:
________________________________________
1. Improve the New Header Bar
Update the blue gradient header to include:
•	A subtitle that dynamically summarizes what the timeline covers
•	A stronger visual hierarchy
•	Executive-style spacing
•	A small divider line between title and subtitle
Example desired structure:
24-Month Implementation Timeline
Strategic milestones, dependencies, and delivery cadence across all phases
________________________________________
2. Add Dynamic Date Range (IMPORTANT)
Instead of hard-coding the date range (e.g., Jan 2023 – Dec 2024), compute it automatically based on:
•	earliest task date from the Mermaid chart
•	latest task date
The header should show:
[Start Date] – [End Date]
Example formats:
•	Jan 2026 – Dec 2026
•	Q1 2026 – Q4 2026
Choose Month YYYY format unless years span more than 24 months.
________________________________________
3. Reduce the White Space Above the Chart
Ensure spacing between:
•	The header
•	The legend
•	The chart container
is tightened to create a more cohesive visual.
________________________________________
4. Add a Subtle “Phase Progress Bar” Under the Header
Create a sleek horizontal indicator with three segments:
•	Foundation (0–6 mo) – blue
•	Growth (6–12 mo) – green
•	Optimization (12–24 mo) – purple
Add labels above or inside each segment.
This component must be responsive and styled in Tailwind.
________________________________________
5. Clean Alignment Above the Gantt Chart
Make sure the header, legend, and chart are consistently aligned in width.
Remove any redundant padding creating gaps.
________________________________________
6. Ensure All Styles Are Fully Contained
Do not break timeline rendering.
Do not change the Mermaid source.
Only improve layout, header, spacing, and added components.
________________________________________
7. Maintain Existing Download PNG Functionality
Ensure new header + improvements are included in the exported PNG.
