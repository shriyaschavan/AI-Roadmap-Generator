I need you to fix two things in the timeline visualization section of results.html:
________________________________________
1. Remove the gap between “PHASE TIMELINE” and the Mermaid Gantt chart
Right now there is unnecessary vertical whitespace between:
•	The Phase Timeline bar
and
•	The Gantt Chart container
I want these two elements to be visually connected, with tight spacing (8–16px at most).
Please:
A. Locate the section inside results.html
It begins around:
<section class="timeline-visualization ...
And contains:
•	.phase-timeline (the 3-phase bar)
•	.gantt-chart-area (Mermaid chart container)
B. Update the styling
1.	Remove margin-top on the .gantt-container or .gantt-chart-area.
2.	Reduce padding-top inside .timeline-body.
3.	Ensure the Phase Timeline block and the chart sit closely together.
4.	Fix any extra <div> wrappers adding spacing.
The result should look like one continuous visual block with no awkward white space.
________________________________________
2. Improve the color scheme of the Gantt chart to be more professional
Please update the Mermaid Gantt theme to use a clean, modern, consulting-grade palette that matches the rest of the app:
Preferred color scheme
•	Foundation phase: #3B82F6 (blue)
•	Growth phase: #10B981 (emerald green)
•	Optimization phase: #8B5CF6 (purple)
•	Milestones: amber #F59E0B
Update the Mermaid themeVariables
Inside the script, find the MERMAID_THEME object and update:
primaryColor
secondaryColor
tertiaryColor
milestone
lineColor
textColor
gridColor
taskTextColor
Use a softer, more premium look:
•	gridColor: #E5E7EB
•	lineColor: #94A3B8
•	textColor: #1E293B
•	taskTextColor: white
•	taskTextOutsideColor: #334155
Also
•	Add light drop shadow to tasks
•	Slight gradient for bar backgrounds
•	Smooth hover animation
Keep styles subtle and professional—not overly bright.

Final Deliverable Requirements
When done, the timeline section should:
1.	Have no visible gap between the Phase Timeline and the chart.
2.	Use a professionally harmonized color palette that matches the UI.
3.	Present a polished consulting-grade visual similar to:
o	McKinsey reports
o	Deloitte transformation timelines
o	BCG-style strategic roadmaps
