PROMPT FOR REPLIT AI — Add “Risk, Complexity & Dependencies Engine”
I want to add a new decision-support feature to the AI Roadmap Generator called Risk, Complexity & Dependencies Engine.
Please implement the following:
________________________________________
1. Backend: Build an evaluation engine
In app.py:
•	After generating the roadmap text, extract each initiative (usually bullet points or bold items).
•	For each initiative, run a new function evaluate_initiative(text) that returns a dictionary:
{
    "risk": int (1–5),
    "complexity": int (1–5),
    "dependencies": [list of prerequisite initiatives or foundational work],
    "recommendation": string summarizing the decision advice
}
•	The scores should be generated using rule-based logic (e.g., keywords like "data", "automation", "integration", "ML", "infrastructure" indicate higher complexity).
•	Store these evaluations in a structure passed into the template as:
initiative_scores = {initiative_name: score_dict}
________________________________________
2. Frontend: Display evaluation under each initiative
In results.html, locate the section where initiatives are rendered inside the “AI Implementation Roadmap” (the prose/markdown output).
Enhance each initiative by injecting a formatted block immediately underneath:
<div class="initiative-meta bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-3 mt-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
    <div><strong>Risk:</strong> {{ score.risk }}/5</div>
    <div><strong>Complexity:</strong> {{ score.complexity }}/5</div>
    <div><strong>Dependencies:</strong> {{ score.dependencies | join(", ") }}</div>
    <div><strong>Recommendation:</strong> {{ score.recommendation }}</div>
</div>
The block should appear for every initiative.
________________________________________
3. Ensure proper mapping between markdown initiatives and the injected metadata
If the roadmap text is in markdown with <strong> initiative titles, match using exact string text.
________________________________________
4. Add basic styling
Add CSS at the bottom of results.html:
.initiative-meta {
    border-left: 4px solid #9ca3af;
}
.initiative-meta strong {
    color: #111827;
}
________________________________________
5. After implementing, verify:
•	Each initiative has Risk, Complexity, Dependencies, and a Recommendation
•	It appears directly under the initiative text
•	No layout shifts or broken formatting
________________________________________
Please implement this now.
